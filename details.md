SDARTS was developed as part of [PERSIVAL](http://persival.cs.columbia.edu/) (an NSF Digital Library Initiative--Phase 2 project) at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/).

SDARTS is a hybrid of two previously existing protocols, [STARTS](http://www-db.stanford.edu/~gravano/starts_home.html) and [SDLIP](http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/~testbed/doc2/SDLIP/). SDARTS is essentially an instantiation of the SDLIP protocol with a richer set of metadata, which can be effectively used for building sophisticated metasearchers. SDARTS makes a wide variety of collections with heterogeneous interfaces accessible under one uniform interface.

The SDARTS toolkit provides ready-to-use, configurable wrappers. They can be used directly for wrapping locally available  text and XML collections, and for wrapping web-accessible databases.

The SDARTS toolkit also contains two optional sets of applications: The [OAI SDARTS Cooperative Suite](http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu/documentation/oai-sdarts.html), which can makes SDARTS OAI-compliant and enables SDARTS to access OAI-compliant collections. We provide the [SDARTS Automatic Content Summary Extraction](http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu/documentation/sdarts-cse.html) for remote web databases, which extracts statistics about the vocabulary and the word frequencies of web databases over which SDARTS does not have immediate access.
