SDARTS is a protocol for metasearching over document collections. You may consider using SDARTS if:

You want to search (one or multiple) text or XML collections that you have from a single search interface.
You want to search remote document collections that export their metadata under the Open Archives protocol.
You want to search multiple web-based document collections from one, single search interface.
SDARTS is available for use and we expand its capabilities continuously! A small-scale deployment is already in place and can be accessed through a web client.
