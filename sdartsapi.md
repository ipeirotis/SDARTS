The SDARTS API provides a way to query the collections indexed by an SDARTS server directly from within an application. The SDARTS API is a web service over SOAP, and the WSDL description of the service is provided, so the developers can use the API using their favorite language.

To use the SDARTS API, developers can either:

Download the [WSDL](http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu:8080/axis/services/SdartsSearchService?wsdl) description of the service (and use for example [SOAP::Lite](http://www.soaplite.com/) for Perl, or Visual Studio .NET, or any other language that supports web services), or

Download the necessary proxy files for Java from the ["Download"](https://github.com/ipeirotis/SDARTS/blob/master/download.md) section.
